# Lerna Starter

Starter Repo Boilerplate for LernaJS Projects @ Blockmatic. 

## Why Lerna?

Lerna.js is tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.

Splitting up large codebases into separate independently versioned packages
is extremely useful for code sharing. However, making changes across many
repositories is _messy_ and difficult to track, and testing across repositories
gets complicated really fast.

To solve these (and many other) problems, some projects will organize their
codebases into multi-package repositories (sometimes called [monorepos](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md)). Projects like [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages), [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/modules),
[Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages), [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages), [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages), and many others develop all of their packages within a
single repository.

**Lerna is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package
repositories with git and npm.**

Lerna can also reduce the time and space requirements for numerous
copies of packages in development and build environments - normally a
downside of dividing a project into many separate NPM packages. See the
[hoist documentation](doc/hoist.md) for details.

## Usage

**Global Dependencies**

- Install node.js v11 on your machine. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n), and [avn](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn) to manage multiple node.js versions on your computer.
- Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/.

**Initial Setup**

Run `yarn install`, `yarn bootstrap` to setup the project. Copy `.env-sample` and create `.env` file with your `GITHUB_TOKEN` for deployment with `lerna release`.

## Commands

- `yarn test`: lerna run test --stream
- `yarn build`: lerna run build --stream
- `yarn lint`: lerna run lint --stream
- `yarn commit`: dev-scripts commit
- `yarn bootstrap`: lerna bootstrap --use-workspaces
- `yarn release`: env-cmd lerna publish
- `yarn diff`: lerna diff
